As part of a BMW-Olympic Partnership, we created a series of social videos based on interviews and training footage with the athletes. For Mantra, we got inside the heads of each athlete and asked them about their personal  'mantra,' or what they tell themselves to stay motivated during training or competing. The result is this visceral video that was used as part of the NBC Olympic coverage in London 2013."data-directedby="Directed & Edited by Kevin Osgood" data-cd="Creative Directors |Rob Collignon & Aileen Calderon">									<img src="image/kvideo1.png"
